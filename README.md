The purpose of this is to enable Arch users to build the most recently commited code to the TrenchBroom GitHub main branch that will eventually roll into TrenchBroom 2024+.

To build TB in your Arch distro of choice from a terminal :

`git clone https://github.com/eGax/arch-pkgbuild-trenchbroom-git.git`<br>
`cd arch-pkgbuild-trenchbroom-git`<br>
`makepkg -si`<br>

<br>
If you want to use the last official release build of TrenchBroom that is 2023.1, highly recommend using my AUR trenchbroom-bin : <br>

or the backup:
